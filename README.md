# About my weather app

Hello and thank you for taking the time to view my weather app project. I created this app using what I have learned through independent studying and undertaking my Master of Information Technology degree online at the University of Southern Queensland.

This app was created using various technologies, including:
- Git for version control, including branches for features and merging to the main branch
- React (Create-React-App) and Javascript
- Tailwind CSS (a CSS framework)
- ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting my code
- Webpack for deploying my app's optimised code
- Github for hosting my code and Github pages for hosting the app's deployed builds.
- OpenWeather APIs for determining longitude and latitude coordinates and for obtaining weather data.
